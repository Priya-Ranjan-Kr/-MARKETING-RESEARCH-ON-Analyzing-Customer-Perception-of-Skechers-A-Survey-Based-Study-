## Statistical Analyses

### Chi-Square Test
A Chi-Square test was conducted to examine the association between age group and frequency of purchase. The null hypothesis was that age group and frequency of purchase are independent of each other.

- **Result**: The test indicated a dependency between age group and purchase frequency (p-value = 0.009873 < 0.05).

### ANOVA
ANOVA was used to determine if product quality rating depends on the frequency of exercise.

- **Result**: A significant difference in mean product quality ratings was found across different exercise frequencies (p-value = 0.006 < 0.05).

### Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis measured the relationship between materials used and product design in determining perceptions of product quality.

- **Result**: A strong positive correlation was found between product design and materials used (correlation coefficient = 0.697, p-value < 0.05).

### Regression Analysis
#### Simple Regression Analysis
Analyzed the dependency of product design perception on the quality of materials used.

- **Result**: Perception of product design is significantly dependent on materials used (R-Square = 0.486, p-value < 0.05).

#### Multiple Regression Analysis
Identified factors significantly impacting the perception of product design.

- **Result**: The model explained 50.4% of the variance in product design perception (Adjusted R-Square = 0.504).

### Factor Analysis
Factor analysis uncovered the latent structure of variables determining customer loyalty.

- **Result**: Two factors were identified: Customer Experience Factor and Prestige Factor, explaining 75.985% of the variance.

### Cluster Analysis
Cluster analysis identified distinct customer groups based on loyalty determinants.

- **Result**: Two clusters were identified: Discerning Customers and Irrational Customers.

## Results
The study found significant factors influencing customer loyalty and perception of product quality. Key findings include the dependency of product design perception on material quality and the identification of distinct customer segments with different loyalty determinants.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into customer perceptions of Skechers, highlighting the importance of product quality and identifying key factors influencing customer loyalty. These insights can help Skechers tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
